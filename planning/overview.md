# Project 2 Frontend Worksheet

## Description: 
**“Archivista.”** is an app that allows a user to manage their personal art collection or create a wishlist for a future collection through a modern, minimal interface. 

**Archivista** is a combination of the words Archive and Vista, referring to the ability to view one’s art archives from a bird’s eye perspective. 

**Archivista** is primarly used by art collectors of all types but can also be used as a way to pin or save artworks to a wishlist for those who are interested in becoming a collector. Users will be able to add new artists/artworks or browse their existing collection by artist or by artworks. 

Features coming soon: sort artworks by user’s personal ratings to bring favorites up to the front.
